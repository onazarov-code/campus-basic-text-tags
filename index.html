      <h2><strong>Writing Text in Paragraphs</strong></h2>
      <p>
        When text appears in a block with several lines, it’s treated as a paragraph. Paragraphs can hold phrases or words that are emphasized or styled in different ways. 
        They can also include links or other inline elements — but not headings. 
        <em>Paragraphs are considered block-level elements.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, you might need to display text that needs a specific layout, like poetry. In that case, you can use line break tags to control where the lines end. 
        <strong>These tags should only</strong> be used for special formatting, such as poems or addresses. Avoid adding line breaks inside normal paragraphs or forms — use CSS instead for proper styling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep in mind that tags like <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> are used to express meaning in text, not just to make words look 
        <b>bold</b> or <i>italicized</i>.

      <h2><em>Excerpt from</em> <strong>The Raven – a Poem by Edgar Allan Poe</strong></h2>

      <p>
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
        As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
        “’Tis some visitor,” I murmured, “knocking at my chamber door—<br>
        Nothing more and nothing less.”

      <h2><strong>Using Text to Communicate Meaning</strong></h2>

      <p>
        Sometimes, only part of a sentence — a few words or letters — needs special meaning. 
        In those cases, it’s best to choose the most descriptive HTML tag for the purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, on a page that displays search results, you may want to highlight words that match the user’s search. 
        If someone searched for “focus area,” that phrase should appear highlighted when shown in the results.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main <mark>focus area</mark> should come from one of four GIT <mark>focus areas</mark> 
        (Front-end Web Development; Photography and Video; Digital Design; or Animation and Publishing). 
        A secondary <mark>focus area</mark> can be any subject that helps support the student’s learning path.
      </p>

      <p>
        Earlier, we mentioned the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags, but not <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>. 
        The underline tag is less common because it can make text look like a hyperlink. 
        A better use is marking <u>spelling</u> or typing mistakes.
